"""
Tuple is an immutable (unchangeable) collection of various 
data type elements. Tuples are used to keep a list of immutable 
Python objects. The tuple is similar to lists in that the 
value of the items placed in the list can be modified, 
however the tuple is immutable and its value cannot be changed.
